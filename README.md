# A Very Large Aerial Stereo Dense Matching Benchmark Open Dataset

This is the Github repository for the stereo dense matching benchmark hosted at [AI4GEO project](http://ai4geo.eu/index.php). 
In order to discuss the transferability of deep learning methods on aerial dataset, we produce **6** aerial dataset at same area, and different area.
